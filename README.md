# Assignment 6 - BFS

Please find attached two files, one with nodes and the other with links of the same undirected network. You have to perform a BFS in this network. Choose as initial node the node corresponding to the two first letters of your name.  Other than that, you may examine a node's neighbors (adjacency list) in any order.  You job is to return the node file with some extra information. In the node file, on each row, replace the words 'parent' and 'distance' by the parent node in the search (None for nodes with no parent) and the distance to the starting node for the corresponding node. Hand in this file with the extra information in cvs format.
